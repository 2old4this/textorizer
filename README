TODO

* crash when changing text file for T2
* hide buttons when rendering and also change labels to "RENDERING" or something


DONE

* allow entering URL in image selector
  => won't do. Textfield could be used but you can't paste in it, so not very useful
* pixel averaging on T2 (7de4794e21448b519a3df840ebc9c48069633933)
* start with different values for words in t1 and t2 (maybe 2 local files) - maybe text field works in controlp5 now? (dbc4b30b19a59c0c66c83693a594be78ef2eeca8)
