TODO


* gaussian filter on pixel sampling in T2
* start with different values for words in t1 and t2 (maybe 2 local files) - maybe text field works in controlp5 now?
* Some kind of watermarking

================

* allow entering URL in image selector
  => won't do. Textfield could be used but you can't paste in it, so not very useful
