TODO

* transparency in rendered text in t1 to avoid http://ffffound.com/image/5f2c347b450b3e70dcf3a0c977adca70b4afc8c8 ?
* different windows for t1/t2/common settings


DONE

* allow entering URL in image selector
  => won't do. Textfield could be used but you can't paste in it, so not very useful
* pixel averaging on T2 (7de4794e21448b519a3df840ebc9c48069633933)
* start with different values for words in t1 and t2 (maybe 2 local files) - maybe text field works in controlp5 now? (dbc4b30b19a59c0c66c83693a594be78ef2eeca8)
* crash when changing text file for T2
  => won't fix - only happens when file is huge and it's a Java memory issue
* hide buttons when rendering and also change labels to "RENDERING" or something (9e1ee567ad01063ba40f91fe0e30536d1d14811a)
* font advance in T2 screwed up after running t1 (fixed: bf6b72a)
